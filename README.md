# This project deals with creating an accounting interface that can help to automate accounting tasks.
# We built an interface to calculate:
# 1. Total sales for each shift and total sales per day
# 2. Workers salary based on hours worked and associated pay per hour
# 3. Profit made from goods sold
# 4. Total tips that was given for each shift
